# Spin-dynamics via dynamic message-passing </br> (dynamic cavity-method)
This repo contains the codes used to compute out-of-equilibrium spin probability distribution for the Ising model at any given temperature. 
The codes implement a novel algorithm introduced in this paper <a href=https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.010102></a>
